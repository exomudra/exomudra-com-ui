# Exomudra Technologies

> Exomudra Technologies is an early-stage deep tech startup based in Chennai, India, currently in the prototyping stage. We are building the next generation human machine interface through wireless smart gloves that enable natural hand gesture interaction with computers, replacing rigid controllers with intuitive and immersive experiences.

## Company Overview

Exomudra Technologies Private Limited is a deep tech startup founded to revolutionize human-machine interaction. The company is incubated at iTNT Hub and focuses on developing advanced motion capture technology through smart gloves.

**Location**: Chennai, India  
**Stage**: Early-stage, prototyping phase  
**Incubator**: iTNT Hub  
**Founded**: 2021  
**Industry**: Deep Tech, Hardware, Motion Capture  

## The Problem We Solve

### Rigid VR Controllers
Current VR input devices are unergonomic and fail to deliver true hand presence, limiting natural interaction and cross-platform adaptability. Their limitations in dexterity, versatility, and expressive control restrict users from having truly immersive experiences.

### Limited Accessibility
9 out of 10 people who use sign language globally don't have access to affordable, accurate translation technology. This creates a significant barrier for communication and accessibility.

### Technology Adaptation
We believe technology should adapt to humans, not the other way around. Current interfaces force users to learn complex control schemes rather than leveraging natural human gestures.

## Our Solution: Smart Gloves

Exomudra develops wireless smart gloves that offer:

### Core Features
- **Natural Hand Gesture Control**: Intuitive hand control that enables natural, immersive interaction
- **Real-time Haptic Feedback**: Enhanced tactile experiences that provide sensory confirmation
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Seamless integration with AR, VR, gaming consoles, Unity, Unreal Engine, and SteamVR
- **Lightweight Design**: Ergonomic construction for extended use sessions
- **Energy Efficient**: Low-cost, battery-optimized design for general consumer use

### Key Applications

#### Game Controller
Replace traditional VR/AR controllers with natural hand gestures for gaming applications, specifically targeting PC/Steam VR ecosystem and indie game development studios.

#### Sign Language Translation
Real-time sign language translation capabilities for improved accessibility and communication, serving the global deaf and hard-of-hearing community.
